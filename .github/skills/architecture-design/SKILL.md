# Comprehensive System Architecture Design

Analyze the user's requirements and design a system architecture that makes its scope, components, data flows, quality attributes, and trade-offs clear. Ground decisions in supplied requirements and repository evidence where available.

## Procedure

1. **Clarify scope and requirements.** Identify functional needs, quality attributes, constraints, success criteria, and known current-state context. Ask concise questions when missing answers would materially change the design. Otherwise proceed with clearly stated assumptions.
2. **Assess the current state.** For brownfield work, review relevant systems, technologies, integrations, technical debt, team expertise, and resource constraints. Distinguish observed evidence from supplied claims and unknowns.
3. **Define architecture boundaries.** State system scope, actors, external dependencies, trust boundaries, and major data flows. Create Mermaid data flow diagrams for the documented principal data flows.
4. **Design components and interfaces.** Describe components, responsibilities, APIs or protocols, persistence, caching, and integration approaches. Avoid unnecessary complexity and specify alternatives where a requirement is unresolved.
5. **Evaluate patterns and quality attributes.** Explain pattern fit and trade-offs for scalability, maintainability, security, observability, resilience, and cost efficiency. Do not treat any principle as an unconditional design rule.
6. **Cover security and deployment.** Describe threat considerations, authentication/authorization, data protection, compliance questions, environments, runtime infrastructure, monitoring, logging, and recovery needs. Treat regulatory applicability as unconfirmed unless the user provides it.
7. **Recommend technologies carefully.** Tie choices to stated constraints and required capabilities. If current product features, prices, or support status are unknown, provide selection criteria instead of asserting current vendor facts.
8. **Create a phased roadmap.** Identify implementation phases, dependencies, validation criteria, risks, and success measures. Use TBD for unsupported owners, dates, costs, or performance targets.
9. **Summarize assumptions and open decisions.** List unknowns that could materially change the architecture and the evidence needed to resolve them.
10. **Validate diagrams.** Use Mermaid with semantic coloring for all architecture diagrams, not ASCII art or diagrams in plain-text code blocks. Follow the [Mermaid authoring instructions](../../instructions/mermaid.instructions.md), including target-renderer validation; report any unavailable rendering checks explicitly. This skill requires semantic coloring even though the general instructions make color optional.

## Output Format

### Architecture overview
System boundaries, actors, external integrations, core principles, and a high-level Mermaid diagram with semantic coloring. Use a fenced `mermaid` block in Markdown, never a plain-text or ASCII architecture diagram. Keep labels tied to described components.

### Requirements and constraints
Functional requirements, quality attributes, technical/business/regulatory/organizational constraints, success criteria, and assumptions.

### Component design
Components, responsibilities, APIs/protocols, data stores, persistence, caching, and key data flows illustrated with Mermaid data flow diagrams.

### Architectural patterns
Selected patterns, fit, trade-offs, complementary patterns, and anti-patterns to avoid.

### Performance and scalability
Scaling approach, required metrics and targets, load distribution, caching, and known or potential bottlenecks. Clearly mark targets as supplied, measured, proposed, or TBD.

### Security and compliance
Threat considerations, identity and access, data protection, encryption, audit, resilience, and compliance questions. Do not claim compliance from design intent alone.

### Deployment and operations
Infrastructure/deployment model, environments, observability, monitoring, logging, recovery, and operational responsibilities.

### Technology recommendations
Recommended capabilities and, when evidence permits, candidate technologies with justification and alternatives.

### Implementation roadmap
Phases, dependencies, risks, validation gates, success measures, and any known resource or schedule constraints. Mark unsupported estimates TBD.

### Assumptions and open questions
List unresolved requirements and decisions that could change the design.

## Diagram Format

- Use Mermaid flowcharts for system/component boundaries, data flow diagrams for data movement, sequence diagrams for interaction timing, and ER diagrams for data relationships. Sequence diagrams and numbered steps may supplement, but must not replace, data flow diagrams for principal data flows.
- Keep explanatory prose and tables; Mermaid replaces text-based diagrams, not the written specification.
- Keep diagrams focused and consistent with the documented design. Do not invent components or relationships to fill a diagram.
- If Mermaid rendering is unavailable, retain the Mermaid source and disclose the limitation rather than substituting an ASCII diagram.

### Data flow diagrams

- Implement data flow diagrams using Mermaid `flowchart` syntax; do not invent a `dfd` diagram directive.
- Show external entities as labeled rectangles, transforming processes as rounded nodes with verb phrases, and persistent data stores as cylinders. Use consistent semantic entity/process/store colors and explain the notation.
- Label every directed edge with the data exchanged (for example, task changes, record versions, or credential verifiers), not merely a protocol, action, or control-flow outcome. Show relevant inputs, outputs, reads, and writes.
- Route stored data through processes; do not connect entities directly to stores or stores directly to each other. Use separate arrows when request and response data differ.
- Identify the system/trust boundary in the diagram or adjacent prose. Keep diagrams focused on documented behavior and preserve interface data when decomposing a larger flow.
- Cover each principal flow, including synchronization reads and significant credential flows. Retain prose for sequencing, transactions, error handling, and unresolved choices; a data flow diagram alone does not establish those guarantees.

### Semantic coloring

- Map colors to architectural roles or outcomes, never node order or decoration. Use the repository's semantic palette for decisions, success, warnings/retries, failures/rollback, and external systems when those roles occur; keep ordinary elements neutral.
- For component roles not covered by that palette, define a small, labeled mapping (for example, client, application, and data store). Reuse each role's meaning and colors across related diagrams and include a legend or adjacent explanation.
- Use reusable `classDef`/`class` roles where supported. For other diagram types, use styling supported by the target renderer; do not copy flowchart-only syntax into sequence or ER diagrams. If semantic styling is unsupported, disclose the limitation and retain explicit role labels rather than emitting invalid syntax.
- Set fill, stroke, and text colors together. Verify at least 4.5:1 normal-text contrast against its fill, and check light/dark themes and exports where relevant.
- Preserve meaning through labels, shapes, or branch text, not color alone. Inspect rendered labels, edges, clipping, and layout; disclose unavailable rendering or accessibility checks.

## Design Principles

- **Scalability**: Choose scaling mechanisms in response to workload and growth requirements, not by default.
- **Maintainability**: Prefer clear boundaries and modular responsibilities.
- **Security by design**: Identify trust boundaries and security controls early; avoid unsupported compliance claims.
- **Observability**: Define how operational behavior will be measured and diagnosed.
- **Resilience**: Address failure modes, recovery, and service continuity.
- **Cost efficiency**: Explain trade-offs, but do not invent pricing or savings.

## Boundaries

- This is an architecture design workflow, not an implementation request; do not modify code or infrastructure.
- Do not make external calls or claim current product capabilities, pricing, or regulatory requirements without evidence in the available context.
- Do not invent requirements, user volumes, performance targets, budgets, team capacity, owners, or timelines; ask or mark them TBD.
- State uncertainty and alternatives where evidence is insufficient.
